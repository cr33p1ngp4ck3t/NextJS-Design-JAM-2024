## Steps for Implementation:

### Step 1: Functional Testing
- **Core Features Tested:**  
  - Product listing: Verified that products display accurately.  
  - Filters and search: Ensured correct results based on user inputs.  
  - Cart operations: Successfully tested adding, updating, and removing items.  
  - Dynamic routing: Confirmed individual product detail pages load correctly.  

- **Tools Used:**  
  - Postman: Tested API responses for accuracy and performance.  
  - React Testing Library: Validated component behavior under various scenarios.  
  - Cypress: Conducted end-to-end testing.  

- **Execution:**  
  - Created detailed test cases for each feature.  
  - Simulated user actions like navigation, form submissions, and clicking buttons.  
  - Compared outputs against expected results to ensure functionality.  

### Step 2: Error Handling
- **Mechanisms Added:**  
  - Utilized try-catch blocks to gracefully handle API failures.  
  - Displayed fallback UI, such as "No items found" messages, in case of data unavailability.  

- **Example Implementation:**  
  ```javascript
  try {
    const data = await fetchProducts();
    setProducts(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to fetch products:", error);
    setError("Unable to load products. Please try again later.");
  }
  ```

### Step 3: Performance Optimization
- **Assets Optimization:**  
  - Implemented lazy loading for large images and assets.  

- **Performance Analysis:**  
  - Enabled browser caching for faster repeat visits.  

- **Load Time Testing:**  
  - Measured initial load and interaction times, achieving a load time of under 2 seconds.  

### Step 4: Cross-Browser and Device Testing
- **Browser Testing:**  
  - Tested functionality and rendering consistency across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  

- **Device Testing:**  
  - Used Developer Mode to test on different device types.  
  - Performed manual testing on physical mobile devices to ensure accuracy.  

### Step 5: Security Testing
- **Input Validation:**  
  - Sanitized user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
  - Used regular expressions to validate inputs like email and phone numbers.  

- **Secure API Communication:**  
  - Ensured API calls were made over HTTPS.  
  - Stored sensitive data such as API keys in environment variables.  

### Step 6: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Simulated Real-World Usage:**  
  - Tested workflows like browsing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.  

- **Feedback Collection:**  
  - Peers and mentors tested the application and provided valuable insights.  

### Step 7: Documentation Updates
- **Included:**  
  - Summarized key testing issues and resolutions.  
  - Attached before-and-after screenshots of fixes.  
  - Provided detailed test case results, optimization steps, and security measures.  

- **Submission Format:**  
  - Submitted documentation in Markdown and PDF formats, including all relevant details.
